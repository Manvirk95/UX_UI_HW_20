                    <br><br>Our team saw firsthand the importance of a clean color scheme that included blues, whites, and dark blue after researching their competitors and other disability websites that didn't meet their expectations of professional design. We also saw clear and strong calls to action, eye-catching pictures, and easy-to-understand service descriptions.</p>

                    <p class="accordian-desc">After conducting the interviews and affinity diagram, these insights helped us to build our user persona.<br><br>William, 33, has been diagnosed with high-functioning autism since he was a young boy and he has always struggled to “fit in” or form relationships. The disability has never stopped him from achieving his goals and he is very passionate about helping others. William needs to help those who are having a difficult time fitting in due to disabilities because of his experience with society's lack of acceptance toward the autistic or disabled community.</p>

                    <p class="accordian-desc">Before designing the hi-fidelity prototypes, I did virtual user testing.<br><br>In our low-fi testing, we discovered that users liked our donation structure but they didn't like the fact there were too many pages.  A lot of users did say to condense the pages.  Also user did mention that the homepage felt cluttered.<br><br>When testing our mid-fidelity, users liked that I condensed the donation pages but they felt that the homepage still clutter even after making a few changes.  So I knew my main focus should be on cleaning up the homepage and keep it simple.<br><br>During the hi-fi testing, my team and I used the A/B testing to confirm the UI design & the UX structure.  We definitely saw a success in our results.  Users loved how clean our design was and the donation page was finally condensed to one page which made our users easy to complete the tasks.<br><br></p>
